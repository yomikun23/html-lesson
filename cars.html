            <h3>HOW IT STARTED</h3>

            <P class="about-content">
                I’d been trying to start this brand for years, but every name I came up with felt forced, fake, or already taken. I was stuck.

Then one random night I’m kicking it with my friends, same vibes as always, laughing, talking mess. Somebody cracked a joke so hard the whole room started dying and one of them goes, “Bro, that’s LOL… Laughing Out Loud, you know how they shorten it.”

A couple minutes later, somebody else said something wild, and without thinking I just blurted, “No lies told.”

The second it left my mouth I said it again slower:  <b>“No… Lies… Told.”  </b> 
Then I threw the acronym on it: “NLT.”

Everybody started repeating it, throwing it back and forth like it had always existed. By the end of the night we weren’t even having the same conversation anymore; we were just finding new ways to slip “No Lies Told” into everything.

That’s when it hit me: that’s the name.  
Not something I sat down and brainstormed for months.  
It came straight out of a real moment, with real people, no filter, no cap.

That’s what this brand is always going to be: real recognition of real moments.  
When something is undeniable, you don’t need a paragraph.  
You just say it how it is:

No Lies Told.
